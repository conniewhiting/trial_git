```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

First read in some data, before making some graphs. I will use the limpet data from day 2

```{r}

limpetsM <- read.csv('limpet.csv')
str(limpetsM)
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(limpetsM, aes(x=DENSITY, y= EGGS, colour=SEASON)) +
  geom_point() 



```
